for scalibility:
    1. set independence_assumption = True, use_filtered_init_candidates = False
    2. set experiments = [(x, 2), (y, 2), ...] s.t. total number of candidates are 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000  

for measure cost:
    1. run generate_filtered_init_candidates.py for larger n values (500 at least)
    2. set independence_assumption = True/False, use_filtered_init_candidates = True
    3. set experiments = [(50, 2), (50, 4), (50, 6), (50, 8), (50, 10)]

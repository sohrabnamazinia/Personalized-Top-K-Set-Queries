I recently bought the iPhone 13 Pro Max, and it’s amazing! The 1TB storage option is perfect for all my photos, apps, and videos. If you’re looking for an iPhone with lots of storage, this is the best choice.
The iPhone 12 has a solid storage option, though I went with the 256GB model. It’s a great phone overall, with a fantastic camera and smooth performance. If storage is a priority, you might consider the Pro models.
I'm using an iPhone SE, and while it’s affordable and compact, the storage maxes out at 128GB. It's decent for everyday use but might not be enough if you need a lot of space for media files.
I switched to an Android phone recently, and I’m loving it! The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has up to 512GB of storage, and it offers a lot of flexibility that iPhones don’t. For anyone needing great storage and customization, this is a solid alternative.
I have the iPhone 11, and it works well for my needs, but the 64GB storage fills up quickly. I often find myself deleting apps and photos to free up space. If storage is important, I'd recommend a newer iPhone model with more capacity.
